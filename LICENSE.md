## Database

The database is a set of JSON files containing data about this karaoke collection. All these files (located in `karaokes` and `tags` folder) are the work of the contributors of this base.

&copy; Kara.moe **Data**base contributors - The Kara.moe **Data**base is made available under the Open Database License. Any rights in individual contents of the database are licensed under the Database Contents License. You should have received a copy of these licenses along with the database. If not, see https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/index.html

## Medias

Videos and music are the property of their respective right holders (which can be found in the `creators` section of each karaoke).

In each `kara.json` file (located in `karaokes`), we strive to fill as much as we can the creators (studios, publishers), the songwriters, the singers and the name of the original work (series or artist).

## Karaokes

All karaokes are property of their respective authors.

The sync work is licensed under [Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 4.0](./LICENSE_CC-BY-SA-4.0.md) for karaokes created for this base. The lyrics **remain** the property of their respective right holders (songwriters and/or publishers).

### Imported karaokes

We sometimes import karaokes from other repositories such as Bakaclub, Japan7, etc. All of them have differents licensing terms and **may not** be compatible with CC-BY-SA 4.0. Unfortunately, we don't have a clear way to flag imported karaokes yet.

We try, as much as possible, to fill the `author` tag in the `.kara.json` files to credit the author of a karaoke. Some of them are under the "Kara.moe" name simply because we are not sure of who created them. If you know, please submit a pull request or contact us.
